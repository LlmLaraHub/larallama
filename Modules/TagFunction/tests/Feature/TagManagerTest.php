        61Accelerate: State of DevOps 2019   |    How Do We Improve Productivity?
        We wondered if the amount of juggling work would be
        significantly different among our highest and lowest
        performers—after all, productivity is the ability to get
        work done and feel like you are in “a flow.”
        To capture this, we asked respondents a few questions:
        • How many roles they juggle or different types of
        work do they do regardless of their official job title
        • How many projects they switched between in a day
        • How many projects they were working on overall

        Surprisingly, we did not detect significant differences
        between low, medium, high, and elite performers.
        Therefore, we cannot conclude that how well teams
        develop and deliver software affects the number of
        roles and projects that respondents juggle. There is
        no such thing as “push through this phase and it will
        get significantly better.” Instead, we should take steps
        to make our work sustainable. That is done through
        process improvement work and automation, which
        will reduce toil and make the work repeatable,
        consistent, fast, scalable, and auditable. It will
        also free us up to do new, creative work.
        PRODUCTIVITY,
        BURNOUT, AND
        JUGGLING WORK
        Technical professionals and tools
        Our work in 2017 found that empowered teams
        who make their own decisions about tools and
        implementations contribute to better software
        delivery performance. In this year’s research, we
        see that given the opportunity, high performers
        choose useful and usable tools, and these kinds
        of tools improve productivity.
        This has important implications for product
        design. Products that have both utility and
        usability are more likely to be adopted by
        technology professionals, and when they are
        used, have better outcomes. These kinds of
        tools should be prioritized by industry leaders.
        It's not enough to deliver products that are
        feature complete; they also need to be usable
        to be adopted and deliver value during a
        DevOps transformation.
