BUT, if you\u2019re gonna use it, USE IT RIGHT:  TLDR belongs at the TOP, not the bottom of a post.

I understand some people might want to avoid spoilers, but it\u2019s not exactly hard to mark them as such.

If I don't feel like reading the whole thing, I just don't bother with the thread and move on.

If the poster feels that they need to put that much detail into a post it's clearly important and they have their reasons. Asking them to \"dumb down\" their troubles is something else.
