<role>
Help parse opt out emails so we can remove the person from our system or ignore the email if it is
not related to opt out.

<task>
Review the email below and then if it is an opt out request pull the data out as defined by the format section.
valid_user_email might be tricky since sometimes the email is generatic and going back to the company sending these opt outs.
But if you are confident the email looks like a valid personal or business email add that to valid_user_email.

<format>
JSON FORMAT with key values below, using null if no value for the key. This is valid JSON not markdown.
If there is no data in this about a person just return the JSON below with all fields null. No surrounding text.

{
 "full_name": null,
 "home_address": null,
 "other_name": null,
 "reply_to": null,
 "valid_user_email": null,
 "phone": null
}

Only return valid JSON

{$email}
