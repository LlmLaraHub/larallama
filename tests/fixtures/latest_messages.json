Despite this, there continues to be significant prescribing of diclofenac; it accounts for 21% of all NSAID items in the East Midlands. In some areas nearly a third of prescriptions for NSAIDs in primary care are for diclofenac.  Ibuprofen and naproxen make up 64% of all NSAID prescriptions in the East Midlands. However, in some areas only half of all NSAID prescriptions are for these preferred agents. idlands. However, in some areas only half of all NSAID prescriptions are for these preferred agents.

Taken from Drug Tariff June 2013. Doses are a guide and do not imply therapeutic equivalence. Recent cohort data have confirmed previous safety warnings that diclofenac has a higher risk of thrombotic events (including Mi and stroke) than naproxen or low-dose ibuprofen. Even a few days of treatment may increase risk, both in healthy individuals and those with cardiovascular disease. High doses of ibuprofen may also have an increased risk.  Two meta-analyses have both estimated that, compared with placebo, diclofenac causes around three additional major vascular events per 1000 patients per year, with one such event causing death.  Diclofenac continues to be widely prescribed; in  s per year, with one such event causing death.  Diclofenac continues to be widely prescribed; in some areas of the East Midlands nearly a third of NSAID prescribing is for diclofenac.  Ibuprofen (1200mg per day or less) or naproxen (1000mg per day or less) are recommended first-line agents, combined with gastro-protection if at high risk for gastrointestinal adverse events. NSAIDs should be prescribed for the shortest time and lowest dose necessary to control symptoms. In 2005 the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) identified an increased risk of thrombotic events, such as myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke with COX-2 inhibitors. In 2006, they advised that a similar link may exist with non-specific NSAIDs, in particular diclofenac, particularly if used at high doses for long-term treatment.  In October 2012, the MHRA confirmed the previous findings, based on a more recent review of the evidence. The currently available data consistently indicate that the risk of Mi, stroke or other thrombotic events is higher for diclofenac t sistently indicate that the risk of Mi, stroke or other thrombotic events is higher for diclofenac than other widely used non-selective NSAIDs and similar to selective COX-2 inhibitors.

Ibuprofen (1200mg per day or less) and naproxen (1000mg per day or less) are considered to have the most favourable cardiovascular safety profiles of all non-selective NSAIDs. All NSAIDs increased the risk of heart failure and of gastrointestinal (GI) events; naproxen having a higher risk of Gl events than ibuprofen or diclofenac.  Results from a Danish cohort study of patients who had suffered a MI suggested that even short-term use of NSAIDs ```\n",

They are late adopters and view competitors more favorably than the pharma company, as their primary goal is symptom relief for their frail patient population.",
