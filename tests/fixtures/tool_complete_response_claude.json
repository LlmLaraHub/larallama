The key points mentioned were:\n\t+ A list of 7 hotels in Paris, each with its own unique characteristics\n\t+ A mention of the best food tours in Paris\n\t+ A guide to secure luggage storage\n\t+ A local's food guide to Paris featuring the city's culinary scene\n* The third response was about summarizing a Tripadvisor page. However, it appears that the actual article text wasn't present, but rather a URL.\n* The fourth response was about helping with specific questions or requests related to the Tripadvisor page.\n\nIf you'd like me to help with anything specific, please let me know!",
